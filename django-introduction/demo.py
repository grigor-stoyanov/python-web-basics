# manage.py is used for executing commands such as runserver,migrate,startapp... simular to django-admin
# django project is a collection of apps
# we start the server with runserver after we have done configurations in settings(e.g. adding tasks,databaces ect.)
# to add an application to our project we can use startapp command from where we can add views and bind them to urls
# be sure to change apps location and references to project folder
# migrate is used to populate database from our code in models or default django apps
# django uses code-first approach to populate database  from existing classes
# command makemigrations checks for changes in apps
# django's biggest plus is built in administration
# admin panel is already installed and added on /admin url
# createsuperuser command adds admin entry to db
# templates are used to differentiate presentation logic from business logic of views
