# data management vs data storage
# different db's have different speeds
# mongodb better at adding, postgreSQL better at searching
# dbms(database management system) imposes rules on contained data
# user doesn't have direct access
# 3 types of relations 1 to 1, 1 to many, many to many
# one user has one profile and one profile has one user
# One country has many Cities but one city has one country
# one employee has many projects and one project has many employees
# foreign key vs primary key
# many to many e.g. employees-projects-mapping table
# junction table adds unique primary key to mapping table
# Structured Query Language
# Addressing many records with 1 command
# SQL statements have clause,and expressions
# Data Definition - CREATE,ALTER,DROP
# Data Manipulation - SELECT,INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE
# Data Control - GRANT,REVOKE,DENY
# Transaction Control - COMMIT,ROLLBACK,SAVE
# Postgre - Relational DB
# extensible
# Fields can be of type char[(M)] fixed length,varchar([N]),TEXT(any length)
# numeric data types SMALLINT,INT,BIGINT,DECIMAL,NUMERIC,REAL,DOUBLE PRECISION,SERIAL,SMALLSERIAL,BIGSERIAL
